# oneAPI IntelÂ® 
Intel OneAPI serves as a comprehensive solution for heterogeneous application development, offering developers the flexibility, performance, and ease of use required to take full advantage of the increasingly diverse computing landscape. It enables developers to write high-performance code that can seamlessly target multiple hardware architectures, accelerating the pace of innovation and unlocking new possibilities in the field of computing.
OneAPI offers a unified programming model that allows developers to write code that can seamlessly target various computing devices, including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. This eliminates the need for separate code bases for different hardware architectures, simplifying the development process and reducing maintenance efforts.

## Project 1: Heart Disease Prediction 
To develop a heart disease prediction model, these algorithms are trained on labeled datasets containing patient data and corresponding heart disease labels. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and the algorithm is trained on the training set to learn patterns and relationships. The model's performance is then evaluated on the testing set to assess its predictive accuracy.
1. Logistic Regression: This algorithm is often used for binary classification problems, making it suitable for predicting the presence or absence of heart disease based on patient features. Logistic regression models estimate the probability of a patient having heart disease based on the input variables.
2. Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It can handle complex relationships between variables and can provide feature importance rankings, helping identify which factors contribute most to heart disease risk.

In this project we have used sciket learn extended by Intel to split the test and train data.

Further, we have used Logistic Regresession and Decision Tree models to test the accuracy of the models.
